and may provide feedback before accepting a PR.
We're happy to work with you to make this the best

## Development

To install the necessary Node dependencies, run ``yarn``.

You can lint the project's JS with ``gulp eslint``
and run the JS unit tests with ``gulp test``.
You can lint Sass with ``gulp sasslint``
and run the Sass tests with ``gulp sasstest``.

To compile and minify the static assets --
as well as generate the documentation --
run ``gulp compile``.

Just running ``gulp`` will perform all of the above tasks.

You can start up a local development server with ``gulp serve``.
This will also watch for changes to local files
and automatically perform an appropriate selection of the above tasks
whenever changes are detected to relevant files.

Access the running server at ``http://localhost:3000``.

Refer to the ``gulpfile.js`` source and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
documentation for more info.
